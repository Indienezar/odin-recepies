In this brutalist HTML project I will implement everything I have learned so far.

That would include:
- Creating HTML boilerplate
- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Bolded and Italic texts using elements "strong" and "em" (TIL you cant use html elements in .md files)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Anchors to new page
- Images
